# How to contribute to googleAnalyticsR

Contributions of any sort are encouraged and very welcome.

## Bugs

If you find anything that looks like a bug, please raise a GitHub issue.  One issue per thread please.

Bugs are much more likely to be fixed if you have a reproduceable example, so please include in the issue. 

Please also report your `sessionInfo()` to check what versions of `googleAnalyticsR` and `googleAuthR` you are running, and run your example with the `option(googleAuthR.verbose = 1)` that will output more console feedback that will help debug.

## Pull requests

Any pull requests are welcome, however small, so typos, documentation improvements etc.

If you are contributing code, then please also include: 

* An entry in the `NEWS.md` that details what has changed
* Add yourself as a contributor to the `DESCRIPTION`
* If you can, create a test using `testthat` which will run through your code. The tests assume you have a authentication file saved at the location indicated by the return of `Sys.getenv("GA_AUTH_FILE")`.  If you don't know how to use `testthat`, an example file in the tests directory will do, which will be converted. 
* Include an example on how to use the function in the examples section
* Try to stick to the same coding style as the rest of the package
* Add some documentation on how to use the functions.
