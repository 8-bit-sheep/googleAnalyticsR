## What goes wrong


## Steps to reproduce the problem



## Expected output



## Actual output

Before you run your code, please run:

`options(googleAuthR.verbose=2)` and copy-paste the console output here.  
Check it doesn't include any sensitive info like auth tokens or accountIds - you can usually just edit those out manually and replace with say `XXX`



## Session Info

Please run `sessionInfo()` so we can check what versions of packages you have installed
