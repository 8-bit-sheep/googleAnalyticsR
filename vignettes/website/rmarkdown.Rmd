`googleAnalyticsR` can be used to generate reports in RMarkdown documents.

## Authentication with RMarkdown

Run your authentication in the setup block, making sure you have run the authentication first outside of RMarkdown, to ensure the necessary `.httr-oauth` file is in the same working directory as the RMarkdown document.

### Example

<pre class="markdown"><code>
---
title: "Google Analytics Report"
author: "Mark Edmondson"
date: "8 July 2016"
output: html_document
---

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(googleAnalyticsR)
## Make sure to run this at least once outside of the document to
##   ensure the .httr-oauth file is present. 
ga_auth()

ga_data <- google_analytics_4(viewId = 12345, 
                              dateRange = c(Sys.Date()-30, Sys.Date()), 
                              metrics = "sessions",
                              dimensions = "medium")
&#96;&#96;&#96;

....use ga_data to generate plots/tables later in the document....

</code></pre>

Alternatively, you can use `googleAuthR::gar_auth_service()` and use the authentication JSON downloaded from the Google console.

## Multi-user authentication

A new feature of `googleAuthR` is authentication from within RMarkdown using javascript authentication instead of Shiny.  A demo of using this with G+ is here: 
https://mark.shinyapps.io/googleAuthRMarkdown/

Similar code can be adapted to use with Google Analytics data.  You will still need to host the RMarkdown document on a Shiny server though, such as http://shinyapps.io

## Uploading RMarkdown files to Shinyapps.io/Shiny Server

To see the reports online, you can upload RMarkdown documents to Shiny servers or shinyapps.io.  

However, you need to ensure that the authentication file is present when uploaded.  This can be specified in the meta data via `resource_files`

<pre class="markdown"><code>
---
title: "Google Analytics Report"
author: "Mark Edmondson"
date: "8 July 2016"
output: html_document
resource_files:
  - .httr-oauth
---
</code></pre>

Then when you upload to Shiny Server or shinyapps.io, you should see the file in your upload choices:
