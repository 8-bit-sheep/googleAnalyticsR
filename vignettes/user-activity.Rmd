```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The [User Activity API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/rest/v4/userActivity/search) lets you query an individual user's movement through your website, by sending in the individual `clientId` or `userId`.  It is accessed via the `ga_clientid_activity()` function.

## User Activity API example

You first need to have a `clientId` or `userId` to query.  You can get this via the User Explorer report in the Web UI, or via a BigQuery export, or if you know the ID from other sources such as you have set the `userId` from your CRM system.

Once you have an ID, specify the Google Analytics view that user was browsing and the data range of the activity you want to query:

```r
a_user <- ga_clientid_activity("1106980347.1461227730",
                               viewId = 81416156, 
                               date_range = c("2019-01-01","2019-02-01"))
```

## Multiple ids

You can send in multiple IDs of the same type in a vector:

```r
two_clientIds <- c("1106980347.1461227730", "476443645.1541099566")
two_users <- ga_clientid_activity(two_clientIds,
                                  viewId = 81416156, 
                                  date_range = c("2019-01-01","2019-02-01"))
```

## Return format

The API returns two types of data: session level and activity hit level.  Access it via `$sessions` or `$hits`:

```r
two_users$sessions
#    sessionId deviceCategory  platform dataSource sessionDate                    id
#1  1548361067        desktop Macintosh        web  2019-01-24 1106980347.1461227730
#2  1548261976        desktop Macintosh        web  2019-01-23 1106980347.1461227730
#3  1548251272        desktop Macintosh        web  2019-01-23 1106980347.1461227730
#4  1548017997        desktop Macintosh        web  2019-01-20 1106980347.1461227730

# ...
```

The data.frames returned include the id you sent in as the `$id` column so you can distinguish between users.

## Filtering the response

If you specify the `activity_type` parameter, you can filter down the response to only the events you include in a vector.  

The permitted types are: `c("PAGEVIEW","SCREENVIEW","GOAL","ECOMMERCE","EVENT")` - include some of these to specify which you would like to see.

```r
only_goals <- ga_clientid_activity(two_clientIds,
                                   viewId = 81416156, 
                                   date_range = c("2019-01-01","2019-02-01"),
                                   activity_types = "GOAL")
```

## Sampled response

The API response may be sampled - it will send a message if this happens.  If it does, follow the advice on the [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/user-reporting) such as splitting up the call into smaller date ranges.
