`googleAnalyticsR` can be used to generate reports in RMarkdown documents.

## RMarkdown Authentication

To authenticate in a non-interactive R environment such as rendering RMarkdown, you are required to setup your own Google Cloud Project with clientId/secret.  See [setting up your own Google Project](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/setup.html#professional-mode-your-own-google-project)

Once that is done, you need to create the email cache details at least once outside of the RMarkdown file - this is a global cache for all projects.

You need to avoid the interactive menu though when using RMarkdown - so specify the email you have authenticated with to skip it e.g. `ga_auth(email="me@work.com")`

Alternatively you can use the JSON service account method - see ["server" mode of authentication help](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/setup.html#server-mode-google-cloud-service-account) for details.

### Example

<pre class="markdown"><code>
---
title: "Google Analytics Report"
author: "Mark Edmondson"
date: "8 July 2016"
output: html_document
---

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(googleAnalyticsR)

## specify an email you have already authenticated with once outside of Rmd
ga_auth(email="me@work.com")

ga_data <- google_analytics(viewId = 12345, 
                            dateRange = c(Sys.Date()-30, Sys.Date()), 
                            metrics = "sessions",
                            dimensions = "medium")
&#96;&#96;&#96;

....use ga_data to generate plots/tables later in the document....

</code></pre>

Alternatively, you can use `googleAuthR::gar_auth_service()` and use the authentication JSON downloaded from the Google console.

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(googleAuthR)
library(googleAnalyticsR)

## service JSON download from your own GCP project
ga_auth_service("your-creds.json)

# service JSON email needs to be added as a user of the viewId to work
ga_data <- google_analytics(viewId = 12345, 
                            dateRange = c(Sys.Date()-30, Sys.Date()), 
                            metrics = "sessions",
                            dimensions = "medium")
&#96;&#96;&#96;

....use ga_data to generate plots/tables later in the document....

</code></pre>

## Multi-user authentication

Using `googleAuthR` is authentication from within RMarkdown using javascript authentication instead of Shiny.  A demo of using this with G+ is here: 
https://mark.shinyapps.io/googleAuthRMarkdown/

Similar code can be adapted to use with Google Analytics data.  You will still need to host the RMarkdown document on a Shiny server though, such as http://shinyapps.io

## Uploading RMarkdown files to Shinyapps.io/Shiny Server

To see the reports online, you can upload RMarkdown documents to Shiny servers or shinyapps.io.  

The recommend method for authenticaation is to use service accounts and `googleAuthR::gar_auth_service()` since this is easier and more secure in the long run. 
However, if you want to continue using `ga_auth()` you need to ensure that the authentication cache file is present when uploaded.  This can be specified in the meta data via `resource_files`

Since the token is not usually saved at a project level since `googleAnalyticsR 0.7.0` you will need to move or specify the cache folder for the tokens.  The cache folder is usually at the global location `~/.R/gargle/gargle-oauth`.  Via `gargle` options, this needs to be changed for a project folder via:

`options(gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets")`

This will then create a project folder containing cache.  Upload this to the server.

<pre class="markdown"><code>
---
title: "Google Analytics Report"
author: "Mark Edmondson"
date: "8 July 2016"
output: html_document
resource_files:
  - .secrets/4324vfdv425v45wvrwer
---
</code></pre>

Then when you upload to Shiny Server or shinyapps.io, you should see the file in your upload choices:

See details on [`gargle` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gargle/vignettes/non-interactive-auth.html)

However, the recommend method is to use service accounts and `googleAuthR::gar_auth_service()` when using a server since this is easier and more secure in the long run.
