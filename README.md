# googleAnalyticsR
A new Google Analytics R library

## Other GA R libraries

* [rga](https://github.com/skardhamar/rga)
* [RGA](https://bitbucket.org/unikum/rga)
* [RGoogleAnalytics](https://github.com/Tatvic/RGoogleAnalytics)
* [ganalytics](https://github.com/jdeboer/ganalytics)

## Why do we need another GA library?

This one uses googleAuthR as a backend, which means:  
* Shiny App compatible
* The same authentication flow can be used with other googleAuthR apps like searchConsoleR
