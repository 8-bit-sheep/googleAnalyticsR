## Features

* First [Google Analytics Reporting v4 API](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/v4.html) library for R
* Automatic [anti-sampling techniques](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/v4.html#anti-sampling) to return more detailed data
* v4 features include: metric expressions, pivots, date comparisons, batching.
* Auto-paging, [auto-authentication](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/setup.html) options
* API metadata of possible metrics and dimensions
* Multi-user login to enable [Google Analytics powered Shiny Apps](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/shiny.html)
* Integration with [BigQuery Google Analytics Premium/360 exports](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/big-query.html).
* Single authentication flow can be used with other [`googleAuthR`](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR/) apps like [`searchConsoleR`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/searchConsoleR)
* Automatic batching, multi-account fetching, multi-channel funnnels
* Support for `googleAuthR` batch.  For big data calls this could be 10x quicker than normal GA fetching
* Meta data in attributes of returned dataframe including date ranges, totals, min and max
* Automatic caching of API requests
* [Management API features such as [unsampled report downloads](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/management.html#unsampled_reports) and [view filter setup](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/management.html#view_filters)
