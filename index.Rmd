## Features

* First Google Analytics Reporting v4 API library for R
* v4 features include: dynamic calculated metrics, pivots, histograms, date comparisons, batching.
* API metadata of possible metrics and dimensions
* Multi-user login in Shiny App
* Integration with BigQuery Google Analytics Premium/360 exports.
* Single authentication flow can be used with other [`googleAuthR`](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR/) apps like [`searchConsoleR`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/searchConsoleR)
* Automatic batching, sampling avoidance with daily walk, multi-account fetching, multi-channel funnnel
* Support for `googleAuthR` batch.  For big data calls this could be 10x quicker than normal GA fetching
* Meta data in attributes of returned dataframe including date ranges, totals, min and max
* Automatic caching of API requests
* Management API features such as unsampled report downloads and filter manipulation
