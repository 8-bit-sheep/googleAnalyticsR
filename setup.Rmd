## Install

The latest stable version of googleAnalyticsR is available on CRAN.
You also need the version > `0.3.0` of `googleAuthR`

```r
install.packages("googleAuthR")
install.packages("googleAnalyticsR")
```

### Development version off github

Or you can use the latest development version is on github which you can install via the below.

Current CRAN check status: [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR)

```r
devtools::install_github("MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR")
```

Check out the [NEWS](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR/blob/master/NEWS.md) to see whats currently available in each version.

## Authentication

```r
## setup
library(googleAnalyticsR)

## This should send you to your browser to authenticate your email.
## Authenticate with an email that has access to the Google Analytics View you want to use.
ga_auth()

## get your accounts
account_list <- google_analytics_account_list()

## pick a profile with data to query
ga_id <- account_list[23,'viewId']

```

Should you need to authenticate under a new user, use `ga_auth(new_user=TRUE)`

## Meta data

To see what dimensions and metrics are available via the API, you can use this command:

```r
## get a list of what metrics and dimensions you can use
ga_auth()
meta <- google_analytics_meta()
```

![](meta_data_screenshot.png)

If offline, from `v0.2.0` this data is also available offline by typing `meta`, although it won't be quite as up to date.  

The meta data does not include multi-channel as they are not available to download, for those [see the online version](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/mcf/dimsmets/).

When using the library, you can call metrics and dimensions with or without the `ga:` prefix (`mcf:` for multi-channel metrics/dimensions.)

### Multiple API authentication

If you are using more than one API for authentication (such as Search Console), then authenticate using `googleAuthR::gar_auth()` instead, to ensure you are authenticate with the correct scopes. 

## Using your own Google Developer Project API Key

With the amount of API calls possible with this library via batching and walking, its more likely the default shared Google API project will hit the 50,000 calls per day limit.

To mitigate that, use your own Google Developer Console Project key, so it is not shared across all users of this library.

### Example adding your own Google Developer Console keys

Set the options before any call to `ga_auth()` or other data fetching calls.

```r
options(googleAuthR.client_id = "uxxxxxxx2fd4kesu6.apps.googleusercontent.com")
options(googleAuthR.client_secret = "3JhLa_GxxxxxCQYLe31c64")
options(googleAuthR.scopes.selected = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics")
```

In the next example, the scopes are also set so a user can authenticate with `searchConsoleR` at the same time, which is possible as they both use [googleAuthR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR/) as a backend.

```r
options(googleAuthR.client_id = "tuxxxxxxx2fd4kesu6.apps.googleusercontent.com")
options(googleAuthR.client_secret = "3JhLa_GxxxxxCQYLe31c64")
options(googleAuthR.scopes.selected = c("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics",
                                        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters"))
```

If you want to use with Shiny, then also set the webapp clientId/secrets.

```r
options(googleAnalyticsR.webapp.client_id = "xxxxx9pcab1u005cv.apps.googleusercontent.com")
options(googleAnalyticsR.webapp.client_secret = "zcofxxxxxxElemXN5sf")
```
