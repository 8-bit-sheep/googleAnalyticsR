# googleAnalyticsR 0.5.0.9000

* Add goal management
* Add `ga_user_deletion()` function (#168)
* Let `authDropdown` return more than just the viewId (#172)
* Export segment related classes and implicitly coerce table filters and segments to their appropriate classes in order to improve integration with the ganalytics package.
* Add support for `dataLastRefreshed` and stop caching if its present (e.g. query includes today) (#183)

# googleAnalytics 0.5.0

## Breaking changes!

If you were using `google_analytics()` before to fetch the v3 API, this is now available via `google_analytics_3()` - replace all instances and it should work as before.  However, you are encouraged to migrate to v4, which now runs when you use `google_analytics()`(and for a while still at `google_analytics_4()` too)

## Major changes

* Add support for resource based quotas if you are on GA360 (#127)
* Improve support for using different auth cache files with `ga_auth()`
* Changed `google_analytics` to be the v4 API, `google_analytics_3` now supports v3
* change default cache token name from `.httr-oauth` to `ga.oauth` to avoid clashes
* You can now change the rows fetched per API page in v4 up to 100k
* Add unsampled report downloads (#44 - many thanks to @j450h1 for this work on this) 
* Add management of View and account filters (#108 - many thanks to @zselinger for the work on this)
* If an `google_analytics` batch API call fails, it will automatically retry with a slower request rate
* v4 API requests will report how long it took to help with configurations

## Bug fixes

* Fix bug where anti-sampling with no dimensions broke (#149 - thanks @smach)
* Let v3 API calls use batching when also using other googleAuthR batching functions

# googleAnalytics 0.4.2

## Bug fixes

* Fix bug of argument match in `multi_select`(#99 - thanks @sdhaus)
* Fix bug for data dimensions starting with a number (#100 - thanks @kennyengci)
* Remove hourly anti-sampling as it doesn't work
* Use tidy eval instead of dplyr underscore funcs (thanks @kiendang)
* Fix multi-channel funnels raising error when no data available (thanks @octaviancorlade)
* Fix NULL validaation if no results returns in v4 API (#81 again - thanks @ricardopinto)

## Additions

* You can now set your `GA_CLIENT_ID`, `GA_CLIENT_SECRET` in environment arguments and they will be added to the project options on startup. 
* Authenticate on startup with `GA_AUTH_FILE` pointing to your cache file.
* Add support for "today" and "yesterday" date values in anti_sample (#112)
* Add that `max` is ignored during `anti_sample=TRUE` (#111)

* Add `aggregateGAData` which will aggregate over GA dimensions
* Add `antiSampleWorked` TRUE/FALSE attribute to tables when anti-sampling attempted
* Add a `slow_fetch` flag to `google_analytics_4` that will avoid batching for big complicated fetches
* Add `ga_users_list` for listing users on account, webProperty or View level
* Set default Google Project API permissions to:
    - `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics"`
