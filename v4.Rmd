title: "Google Analytics Reporting API v4 in R Examples"
---

The v4 API will be where new features will appear in the future.  

It currently has these extras implemented over the v3 API:

* Cohorts
* Multiple date ranges
* Pivot tables
* Calculated metrics on the fly
* Much more powerful segments
* Quota system for GA360
* Caching

Check out more examples on using the API in actual use cases on the [www.dartistics.com website](http://www.dartistics.com/googleanalytics/index.html).

## Getting started

To get started refer to the tutorials linked on the homepage, consult `?google_analytics` when within R to see the documentation, and refer to these example queries:

```r
## setup
library(googleAnalyticsR)

## authenticate
ga_auth()

## get your accounts
account_list <- ga_account_list()

## account_list will have a column called "viewId"
account_list$viewId

## View account_list and pick the viewId you want to extract data from
ga_id <- 123456

## simple query to test connection
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date")
```

[Jeff Swanson](http://jeffgswanson.com/) has made a video guide that goes into more detail about the above examples ([Digital Marketing in R: How to Connect to Google Analytics API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9mSh5kcRgc&feature=share)) and embedded below, many thanks to Jeff.

## Number of results

By default the function will return 1000 results.  If you want to fetch all rows, set `max = -1`

You don't have to worry about dealing with paging through the API yourself, the library deals with that for you. 

```r
# 1000 rows only
thousand <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                             date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                             metrics = "sessions", 
                             dimensions = "date")

# 2000 rows
twothousand <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                             date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                             metrics = "sessions", 
                             dimensions = "date",
                             max = 2000)  

# All rows
alldata <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                             date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                             metrics = "sessions", 
                             dimensions = "date",
                             max = -1)   

```

If you are using anti-sampling, it will always fetch all rows.  This is because it won't make sense to fetch only the top results as the API splits up the calls over all days.  If you want to limit it afterwards, use R by doing something like:

```r
## anti_sample gets all results (max = -1)
gadata <- google_analytics(myID,
                      date_range = c(start_date, end_date),
                      metrics = "pageviews",
                      dimensions = "pageTitle",
                      segments = myseg,
                      anti_sample = TRUE)

## limit to top 25
top_25 <- head(gadata[order(gadata$pageviews, decreasing = TRUE), ] , 25)
```


## Date Ranges

You can send in dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format:

```r
google_analytics(868768, date_range = c("2016-12-31", "2017-02-01"), metrics = "sessions")
```

Character dates are converted into `Date` objects, so you can supply those directly, and use R's Date handling to specify rolling dates:

```r
yesterday <- Sys.Date() - 1
3daysAgo <- Sys.Date() - 3

google_analytics(868768, date_range = c(3daysAgo, yesterday), metrics = "sessions")
```

Or use the v4 API shortcuts directly such as `"yesterday"`, `"today"` or `"XDaysAgo"`:

```r
google_analytics(868768, date_range = c("5daysAgo", "yesterday"), metrics = "sessions")
```

### Compare date ranges

New to v4 you can compare date ranges and return the two data sets in one call.  Simply send in a 4-length vector of dates in the form `(range1_start, range1_end, range2_start, range2_end)`

```r
google_analytics(868768, 
                   date_range = c("16daysAgo", "9daysAgo", "8daysAgo", "yesterday"), 
                   metrics = "sessions")
```

When requesting multiple date ranges, you can use a new ordering feature of v4 to find the 10 most changed dimensions, rather than just say the top 10.  [An article about using this feature can be found here](http://code.markedmondson.me/quicker-insight-sort-metric-delta/).

An example is shown below, using the `order_type` function to sort by the change (`DELTA`) between dates:

```r
delta_sess <- order_type("sessions","DESCENDING", "DELTA")

## find top 20 landing pages that changed most in sessions comparing this week and last week
gadata <- google_analytics(gaid,
                             date_range = c("16daysAgo", "9daysAgo", "8daysAgo", "yesterday"),
                             metrics = c("sessions"),
                             dimensions = c("landingPagePath"),
                             order = delta_sess,
                             max = 20)
```

## Anti-sampling

A new feature from version `0.3.0` is anti-sampling via batching.

Sampling is due to your API request being over the session limits [outlined in this Google article](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192).  This limit is higher for Google Analytics 360.  

If you split up your API request so that the number of sessions falls under these limits, sampling will not occur.

### Sampled data example

If you have sampling in your data request, `googleAnalyticsR` reports it back to you in the console when making the request. 

```r
> library(googleAnalyticsR)
> ga_auth()
> sampled_data_fetch <- google_analytics(id, 
                                           date_range = c("2015-01-01","2015-06-21"), 
                                           metrics = c("users","sessions","bounceRate"), 
                                           dimensions = c("date","landingPagePath","source"))
Calling APIv4....
Data is sampled, based on 39.75% of visits.
```

### Unsampled data example

Setting the new argument `anti_sample=TRUE` in a `google_analytics()` request now causes the calls to be split up into small enough chunks to avoid sampling.  This uses more API calls so the data will reach you slower, but it should hold more detail.

```r
> library(googleAnalyticsR)
> ga_auth()
> unsampled_data_fetch <- google_analytics(id, 
                                             date_range = c("2015-01-01","2015-06-21"), 
                                             metrics = c("users","sessions","bounceRate"), 
                                             dimensions = c("date","landingPagePath","source"),
                                             anti_sample = TRUE)

anti_sample set to TRUE. Mitigating sampling via multiple API calls.

```

The sequence involves a couple of exploratory API calls to determine the best split.  This method will adjust the time periods to have the batch sizes large enough to not take too long, but small enough to have unsampled data.

### Auto-anti sampling failure

In some cases the anti-sampling won't work.  This will mainly be due to filters for the View you are using meaning that the calculation for the sampling sessions are incorrect - Google Analytics vanilla samples on a property level (whilst GA360 samples on a View level).  

Try using a raw profile if you can, otherwise you can set your own sample period by using the `anti_sample_batches` flag to indicate the sample size.  Pick a number that is a little lower than the smallest period you saw in the auto-sample batches.  If in doubt, setting `anti_sample_batches` to 1 will make a daily fetch.

## Filter Syntax

Filters need to be built up from the `met_filter` and `dim_filter` R objects.

These then need to be wrapped in `filter_clause_ga4` function, which lets you specify the combination rules (`AND` or `OR`).  The `met_filter` and `dim_filter` you pass in should be wrapped in a `list()` - see examples:

```r

## one filter
campaign_filter <- dim_filter(dimension="campaign",operator="REGEXP",expressions="welcome")

my_filter_clause <- filter_clause_ga4(list(campaign_filter))

data_fetch <- google_analytics(ga_id,date_range = c("2016-01-01","2016-12-31"),
                                 metrics = c("itemRevenue","itemQuantity"),
                                 dimensions = c("campaign","transactionId","dateHour"),
                                 dim_filters = my_filter_clause,
                                 anti_sample = TRUE)
```

Example with multiple filters:

```r

## create filters on metrics
mf <- met_filter("bounces", "GREATER_THAN", 0)
mf2 <- met_filter("sessions", "GREATER", 2)

## create filters on dimensions
df <- dim_filter("source","BEGINS_WITH","1",not = TRUE)
df2 <- dim_filter("source","BEGINS_WITH","a",not = TRUE)

## construct filter objects
fc2 <- filter_clause_ga4(list(df, df2), operator = "AND")
fc <- filter_clause_ga4(list(mf, mf2), operator = "AND")

## make v4 request
## demo showing how the new filters work
ga_data1 <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                              date_range = c("2015-07-30","2015-10-01"),
                              dimensions=c('source','medium'), 
                              metrics = c('sessions','bounces'), 
                              met_filters = fc, 
                              dim_filters = fc2, 
                              filtersExpression = "ga:source!=(direct)")

## Multiple reports

Example with two date ranges and two reports.  When querying two date ranges, you can sort the metrics by how much they have changed by using `orderType = DELTA` e.g. `order_type("sessions", "DESCENDING", "DELTA")`

When fetching multiple reports, you need to wrap the `make_ga_4_req()` created objects in a `list()`


```r
## demo of querying two date ranges at a time   
## we make the request via make_ga_4_req() to use in next demo
multidate_test <- make_ga_4_req(ga_id, 
                                date_range = c("2015-07-30",
                                               "2015-10-01",
                                               "2014-07-30",
                                               "2014-10-01"),
                                dimensions = c('source','medium'), 
                                metrics = c('sessions','bounces'),
                                order = order_type("sessions", "DESCENDING", "DELTA"))

## wrap the request in a list - makes more sense when more than one.                                
ga_data2 <- fetch_google_analytics(list(multidate_test))

## Segments v4

Segments are more complex to configure that v3, but more powerful and in line to how you configure them in the UI.

A lot of feedback for the library is on how to get the sample syntax right, so the examples below try to cover common scenarios.

### v3 segments

You can choose to create segments via the v4 syntax or the v3 syntax for backward compatibility.

If you want to use v3 segments, then they can be used in the `segment_id` argument of the `segment_ga4()` function.

You can view the segment Ids by using `ga_segment_list()` and the data.frame in `$items`

```r
## get list of segments
my_segments <- ga_segment_list()

## just the segment items
segs <- my_segments$items

## segment Ids and name:
segs[,c("name","id","defintion")]

The ID you require is in the `$id` column which you need to prefix with "gaid::"

```r
## choose the v3 segment
segment_for_call <- "gaid::-4"

## make the v3 segment object in the v4 segment object:
seg_obj <- segment_ga4("PaidTraffic", segment_id = segment_for_call)

## make the segment call
segmented_ga1 <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                                    c("2015-07-30","2015-10-01"), 
                                    dimensions=c('source','medium','segment'), 
                                    segments = seg_obj, 
                                    metrics = c('sessions','bounces')
                                    )
  
``` 

...or you can pass the v3 syntax for dynamic segments found from the `$definition` column:

```r
## or pass the segment v3 defintion in directly:
segment_def_for_call <- "sessions::condition::ga:medium=~^(cpc|ppc|cpa|cpm|cpv|cpp)$"

## make the v3 segment object in the v4 segment object:
seg_obj <- segment_ga4("PaidTraffic", segment_id = segment_def_for_call)

## make the segment call
segmented_ga1 <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                                    c("2015-07-30","2015-10-01"), 
                                    dimensions=c('source','medium','segment'), 
                                    segments = seg_obj, 
                                    metrics = c('sessions','bounces')
                                    )
```


### v4 segment syntax

However, its recommended you embrace the new v4 syntax, as its more flexible and powerful in the long run.

The hierarachy of the segment elements you will need are:

* *`segment_ga4()`* - this is the top of the segment tree.  You can pass one or a list of these into a `google_analytics()` segment argument.  Here you name the segment as it will appear in the `segment` dimension, and pass in segment definitions either via an existing segmentID or v3 definition; via a user scoped level; or via a session scoped level.  The user and session scopes can have one or a list of `segment_define()` functions.
* *`segment_define()`* - this is where you define the types of segment filters that you are passing in - they are combined in a logical AND.  The segment filters can be of a `segment_vector_simple` type (where order doesn't matter) or a `segment_vector_sequence` type (where order does matter.)  You can also pass in a `not_vector` of the same length as the list of segment filters, which dictates if the segments you pass in are included (the default) or excluded.
* *`segment_vector_simple()`* and *`segment_vector_sequence()`* - these are vectors of `segment_element`, and determine if the conditions are included in a logical OR fashion, or if the sequence of steps is important (for instance users who saw this page, then that page.)  
* *`segment_element`* - this is the lowest atom of segments, and lets you define on which metric or dimension you are segmenting on. You pass one or a list of these to *`segment_vector_simple()`* or *`segment_vector_sequence()`*


```r
## make two segment elements
se <- segment_element("sessions", 
                      operator = "GREATER_THAN", 
                      type = "METRIC", 
                      comparisonValue = 1, 
                      scope = "USER")

                      type = "DIMENSION", 
                      expressions = "organic")

## choose between segment_vector_simple or segment_vector_sequence
## Elements can be combined into clauses, which can then be combined into OR filter clauses
sv_simple <- segment_vector_simple(list(list(se)))

sv_simple2 <- segment_vector_simple(list(list(se2)))

## Each segment vector can then be combined into a logical AND
seg_defined <- segment_define(list(sv_simple, sv_simple2))

## Each segement defintion can apply to users, sessions or both.
## You can pass a list of several segments
segment4 <- segment_ga4("simple", user_segment = seg_defined)

### RStudio Addin: Segment helper

New in version 0.2.0 is an RStudio Addin to help create segments via a UI rather than the lists above.

You can call it via `googleAnalyticsR:::gadget_GASegment()` or within the RStudio interface like displayed below:

## Cohort reports

Details on [cohort reports and LTV can be found here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/advanced#cohorts).

```r
## first make a cohort group
cohort4 <- make_cohort_group(list("Jan2016" = c("2016-01-01", "2016-01-31"), 
                                "Feb2016" = c("2016-02-01","2016-02-28")))

## then call cohort report.  No date_range and must include metrics and dimensions
##   from the cohort list
cohort_example <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                                     dimensions=c('cohort'), 
                                     cohort = cohort4, 
                                     metrics = c('cohortTotalUsers'))

cohort_example
#    cohort cohortTotalUsers
# 1 Feb2016            19040
# 2 Jan2016            23378

```

## Pivot Requests

These change the shape of the returned data

```r

## filter pivot results to 
pivot_dim_filter1 <- dim_filter("medium",
                                "REGEXP",
                                "organic|social|email|cpc")
                                
pivot_dim_clause <- filter_clause_ga4(list(pivot_dim_filter1))

pivme <- pivot_ga4("medium",
                   metrics = c("sessions"), 
                   maxGroupCount = 4, 
                   dim_filter_clause = pivot_dim_clause)

pivtest1 <- google_analytics(ga_id, 
                               c("2016-01-30","2016-10-01"), 
                               dimensions=c('source'), 
                               metrics = c('sessions'), 
                               pivots = list(pivme))


names(pivtest1)
#  [1] "source"                      "sessions"                    "medium.referral.sessions"   
#  [4] "medium..none..sessions"      "medium.cpc.sessions"         "medium.email.sessions"      
#  [7] "medium.social.sessions"      "medium.twitter.sessions"     "medium.socialMedia.sessions"
# [10] "medium.Social.sessions"      "medium.linkedin.sessions"  

```

## GA360 Quota System

If you have GA360, you have access to [resource based quotas](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/resource-based-quota) that increase the number of sessions before sampling kicks in from 1 to 100 million sessions. 

To access this quota, set `useResourceQuotas = TRUE` in the command.


```r
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date",
                 max = -1,
                 useResourceQuotas = TRUE)
```

## Customising API fetches

`googleAnalyticsR` has some techniques implemented to get the data as quickly as possible.  This includes:

### Batching large results

The v4 API allows you to send 5 calls at once in one request, meaning by default 50,000 rows can be requested at once.  However, since this puts additional strain on the Google servers for complicated queries this may fail with a 500 error.  If so, the library will fall back to the slower fetching of 10,000 rows per API call.

If you want to default to the slower fetching, set `slow_fetch=TRUE` in your request e.g.

```r
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date",
                 max = -1,
                 slow_fetch = TRUE)
```

### Caching

Local caching is enabled that will mean if you make the exact same API request with all arguments the same, the result will come from memory rather than the API.  By default this is within the RAM of the same R session, but if you want you can set this to save the cache to disk using the `ga_cache_call()` function.  Use this to point to a folder to store the cache files.

e.g.

```r
ga_cache_call("my_cache_folder")

## will make the call and save files to my_cache_folder
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date",
                 max = -1)
                 
## making the same exact call again will read from disk, and be much quicker
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date",
                 max = -1)
```

This means that repeated long fetches will be quicker as older requests will read from disk.  If you are running long repeated calls over time, this is a good strategy to only fetch the latest data from the API, and rely on the cache for historic data. 

### Rows Per call

The API lets you call up to 100,000 rows per API call, which coupled with the batching above means potentially 500,000 rows can be called.  In reality though, this many rows will be too heavy for the Google servers, so you may want to experiment using increased row per calls but with `slow_fetch=TRUE` to find the optimum.  

e.g.

```r
## making the same exact call again will read from disk, and be much quicker
google_analytics(ga_id, 
                 date_range = c("2017-01-01", "2017-03-01"), 
                 metrics = "sessions", 
                 dimensions = "date",
                 rows_per_call = 40000,
                 slow_fetch = TRUE,
                 max = -1)
```

The defaults are 10,000 rows per call (50,000 per batch) and `slow_fetch = FALSE` which suit for most cases. 

## Fetching from multiple views

Whilst the v3 batching isn't available for multi-accounts, by using [`future.apply`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.apply) you can launch multiple R sessions that will fetch the API in parallel.  An example is shown below, that fetches from three View IDs at once.

The limiting factor willl then be the v4 [API limits](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/limits-quotas), which are currently 1000 requests per 100 seconds per user, per Google API project (e.g. you will probably want to setup your own Google project if making a lot of requests)

```r
library(googleAnalyticsR)
library(future.apply)

## setup multisession R for your parallel data fetches 
plan(multisession)

## the ViewIds to fetch all at once
gaids <- c(12345634, 9888890,10624323)

my_fetch <- function(x) {
  google_analytics(x, 
                   date_range = c("2017-01-01","yesterday"), 
                   metrics = "sessions", 
                   dimensions = c("date","medium")
}

## makes 3 API calls at once
all_data <- future_lapply(gaids, my_fetch)
```
