## googleAnalyticsR

Welcome to the website for **googleAnalyticsR**, an R library for working with [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/) data.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR/master/inst/hexlogo/hex.png)

Follow development on the project's [Github development site.](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR) or browse the [development documentation of googleAnalyticsR](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/dev/index.html) which is subject to change.

The Slack group `googleAuthRverse` includes a `#googleAnalyticsR` channel. For news, chat and support join via this [request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerjirmMpB3b7LmBs_Vx_XPIE9IrhpCpPg1jUcpfBcivA3uBw/viewform). 

Collaboration is welcomed and encouraged, if you are interested get in touch.

## Features

* First [GA4 Data API R package](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/reporting-ga4.html) for fetching data from GA4 properties
* Send server-side Measurement Protocol v2 hits to GA4 via the [measurementProtocol R package](https://code.markedmondson.me/measurementProtocol/)
* First [Google Analytics Reporting v4 API](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/v4.html) library for Universal Analytics to R
* Automatic [anti-sampling techniques](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/v4.html#anti-sampling) to return more detailed data
* v4 features include: metric expressions, pivots, date comparisons, batching.
* Auto-paging, [auto-authentication](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/setup.html) options
* API metadata of possible metrics and dimensions
* GA360 support for features such as [resource quotas](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/v4.html#ga360_quota_system).
* Multi-user login to enable [Google Analytics powered Shiny Apps](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/shiny.html)
* Integration with [BigQuery Google Analytics Premium/360 exports](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/big-query.html).
* Single authentication flow can be used with other [`googleAuthR`](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR/) apps like [`searchConsoleR`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/searchConsoleR)
* Automatic batching, multi-account fetching, multi-channel funnnels
* Support for `googleAuthR` batch.  For big data calls this could be 10x quicker than normal GA fetching
* Meta data in attributes of returned dataframe including date ranges, totals, min and max
* The `.gamr` file format for [sharing modelling analysis of Google Analytics data](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/models.html).
* Automatic caching of API requests
* Management API features such as [unsampled report downloads](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/management.html#unsampled_reports) and [view filter setup](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/articles/management.html#view_filters)

## Thanks 

These are all great libraries that also work with Google Analytics data in R, that I have taken inspiration from.

Thanks also to the many contributors to the package that have been creating features, finding and fixing bugs and giving feedback.  They have all helped create the package as it is today.  In particular Jas Sohi (@j450h1) and Zoran Selinger (@zselinger) for their work on new management API features.

## My website

There are some blog posts on using googleAnalyticsR and various other data science code for digital marketing on my blog: [Mark Edmondson's Blog](https://code.markedmondson.me).  

There you can also see other [R packages working with digital marketing applications](http://code.markedmondson.me/r-packages/) such as `searchConsoleR`, `bigQueryR` and `googleMeasureR`.
